Here is the software that accompanies the book of Bruno Cordani
        Geography of Order and Chaos in Mechanics,
        Investigations of Quasi-Integrable Syastems with
        Analytical, Numerical, and Graphical Tools (2nd edition)
        Birkhauser (2024)
The software uses some numerical tools, such as Poincar√© section, FFT,
Wavelets, and Frequency Modulation Indicator (FMI), which detects the
distribution of the resonances among the fundamental frequencies.
The book describes five programs
- POINCARE program analyzes symplectic maps with the aid of the FMI.
- HAMILTON program analyzes Hamiltonian systems with the FMI.
- LAGRANGE program concerns the Lagrange points in the three-body problem.
- KEPLER program studies the perturbations of the Kepler problem.
- LAPLACE program concerns the dynamics of a solar system and in particular its (in)stability.
A compiled version of the five programs is also provided for those who do not have access
to a MATLAB installation.
