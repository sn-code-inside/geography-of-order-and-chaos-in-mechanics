******************* The LAGRANGE program *********************************************
The Lagrange points are relative equilibrium points of the circular restricted 3-body
problem, a special case of the general 3-body problem: two bodies move in circular orbits
at unitary distance about the common center of mass, according to the laws of the 2-body
dynamics, while a third body of negligible mass moves in their gravitational field. There
are five equilibrium points in the rotating reference system, since the centrtifugal
force can balance the gravity. Three of them are placed on the x axis, which
encompasses the two rotating masses, and are named L1,L2,L3: they are always unstable.
The other two are L4 and L5 and along with the two rotating masses they form two equilater
triangles, the third vertex having, respectively, positive and negative y coordinate.
The LAGRANGE program investigates numerically the dynamics and with the FMI tool
finds the distribution of the resonances in the neighbourhood of L4.

In the panel "Lagrangian Equilibrium Points" the user can choose one of the five
equilibrium points.

In the panel "Single orbit analysis" one can investigate numerically the dynamics of a
point, visualizing the evolution of the physical coordinates and, for L4,
of the action-angle variables. The initial conditions are the distance
from the equilibrium point and the velocity. Starting
from a point very close to L4, as expected the actions are nearly constant and the angles
grow linearly in the time: the hamiltonian system behaves in practice as integrable,
the perturbative parameter being the distance from L4.

In the third panel "ODE solver" the user can choose the method for the numerical integration
with the relative options.

In the "Frequency Modulation Indicator" panel you can choose the parameter values in
order to analyze the selected Hamiltonian. Clearly, increasing the step number you will
get a better resolution in the final plot. For a description of the FMI tool, see
subsection 5.3.4 of the book.
In order to obtain good results, the computations require very long times, which can
be shortened if the computer is a multicore machine. Indeed, LAGRANGE is able to
parallelize the computations in the following way. If you possess an n-core machine,
in an empty folder "Lagrange" create a subfolder "Master" and n-1 subfolders Slave1,
Slave2, . . . , then copy the whole program LAGRANGE identically in every folder.
Start MATLAB then LAGRANGE from the Master folder, set the parameters and click on
"Save setting now". Without closing, start a new instance of MATLAB, then LAGRANGE
from a folder SlaveX: you will notice that the new button "Start Slave" appears.
Click on this button and LAGRANGE will wait for the start of the master.
Redo for every slave, lastly go back to the master and click on "Calculate...".
The whole work will be automatically shared among the n cores.
