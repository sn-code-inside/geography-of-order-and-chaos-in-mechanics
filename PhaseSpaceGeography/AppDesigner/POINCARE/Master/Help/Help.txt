********************* The POINCARE program **************************************
The POINCARE program investigates the behaviour of a symplectic map and
finds the distribution of the resonances with the FMI tool.
In the 6-dimensional phase space of a Hamiltonian system with three degrees of
freedom, let us fix the value of the energy and consider the 5-dimensional
hypersurface given by H(q,p) = const. Recording the intersection points of an orbit
generated by the Hamiltonian with a 4-dimensional plane transverse to the flow,
one gets a mapping of the plane into itself which is symplectic. A suitably chosen
4D symplectic map can therefore "simulate" the dynamical evolution of a
quasi-integrable Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom.
The absence of integration errors ensures the objectivity of the result
and that spurious artifacts do not take place.

************************* The Map panel ********************************************
In the panel "Map" you can choose the map, the value of the perturbing parameters
and the iteration number. At the moment four different maps are supplied: APLE, FGL,
FGLsteep, and ROT. See subsection 5.4.1 of the book for a description. The map User can be
overwritten at will opening the file Function\User.m.

**************** The Frequency Modulation Indicator panel **************************
In the "Frequency Modulation Indicator" panel you can choose the parameter values in
order to analyze the selected map. Clearly, increasing the step number you will get
a better resolution in the final plot. For a description of the FMI tool, see
subsection 5.3.4 of the book.
In order to obtain good results, the computations require very long times, which can
be shortened if the computer is a multicore machine. Indeed, POINCARE is able to
parallelize the computations in the following way. If you possess an n-core machine,
in an empty folder "Poincare" create a subfolder "Master" and n-1 subfolders Slave1,
Slave2, . . . , then copy the whole program POINCARE identically in every folder.
Start MATLAB then POINCARE from the Master folder, set the parameters and click on
"Save setting now". Without closing, start a new instance of MATLAB, then POINCARE
from a folder SlaveX: you will notice that all the buttons of the computations are
disabled while the new button "Start Slave" appears. Click on this button and POINCARE
will wait for the start of the master. Redo for every slave, lastly go back to the master
and click on "Calculate and plot". The whole work will be automatically shared among
the n cores.

********************* The Frequency Demodulation panel ******************************
The panel "Frequency Demodulation" computes the two frequency evolutions of the map
starting from the point x_1,x_2. A constant evolution identifies a regular torus well
away from any resonance, an oscillating one detecs a regular torus in the neighborhood 
of a resonance, and an irregular one a chaotical evolution.
Clicking on the pushbutton "Start ...", the analysis starts. To stop the run, click
(several times, it may be) on "Stop ...".
