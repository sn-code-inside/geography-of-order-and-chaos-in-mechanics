                          * INTRODUCTION (for the impatient) *
                          ********************************************

The KEPLER program, written in MATLAB language, calculates numerically and displays the
solutions of the Hamiltonian system describing the perturbed Kepler problem. The obvious
approach consists in a straightforward numerical integration of the six Hamilton equations
with the ODE solvers coming with MATLAB. This "standard method" is implemented in KEPLER
just for comparison's sake and is useful, in particular, when the motion is unbounded.
Indeed, this method suffers of two drawbacks.

(i) Approaching the singularity in the origin, the integration step should be shortened
to maintain a good precision but the integration method is not always equipped with an
adaptive step mechanism, or this mechanism is efficient enough.

(ii) The integration errors affect also the unperturbed solution, which is instead
exactly (i.e., analytically) known.

Thus, more sophisticated methods are utilized, which exploit the group--geometrical
structure of the unperturbed Kepler problem. KEPLER offers two regularization methods.

(i) The perturbative method. With regard to the first point above, the unperturbed
motion is described by a uniform rotation of two quadrivectors subjected to two
constraints: they are orthogonal and have the same norm. The motion, which is identical
to the geodesical motion on a 3-dimensional sphere, turns out to be regularized and the
solution may pass unharmed in the neighbourhood of the singularity. Moreover, the two
vectors constitute a global coordinate system in phase space. The time is replaced by a
so-called "false time", which tends to the eccentric anomaly when the perturbation is
vanishing. For the second point, the method of the variation of the constants is
utilized, exploiting our knowledge of the unperturbed solution. In other words, only
the small difference between perturbed and unperturbed solution is calculated,
minimizing the numerical errors.

(ii) The non-perturbative method. Alternatively, the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
transformation regularizes the motion, which is reduced to that of a 4-dimensional
oscillator subject to a constraint. When the perturbation is not very small, it may be
convenient to integrate directly the regularized Hamilton equations of the perturbed
problem with an integration methods which solves exactly the oscillator problem.

The price to pay, in using the above methods, is that the initial conditions must be
normalized. Thus KEPLER, in a transparent manner, rescales the initial conditions,
performs the numerical integration and, finally, restores the initial situation. For
that, the perturbation Hamiltonian must be a linear combination of homogeneous terms in
the components of position and velocity vectors, with homogeneity degrees, however,
completely arbitrary. The coefficients of the linear combination are the suitably
rescaled values of epsilon, the perturbative parameters.

The use of the program should be, as we hope, easy and intuitive, at least regarding
the more elementary functionalities. Indeed, at every stage only the buttons which is
sensible to push are enabled, so that the user is almost guided along the right
sequence of clicking. The command statements of KEPLER are gathered in four windows,
which one selects in the popupmenu in the left-top corner. The first (default) window
is devoted to the study of a single orbit, and is composed by seven panels. Reading it
like a printed page, i.e., from left to right and from top to bottom, we find what
follows.

In the first panel, entitled "Perturbation Hamiltonian", the user can combine various
Hamiltonians chosen from a menu. The list may be easily enlarged writing a file similar
to those found in the subdirectory "H_perturbation".

In the second panel "Initial conditions", the user can give the relative information,
fixing the initial position and velocity or the Keplerian parameters: once changed one
of the subpanels, the other must be updated before to continue.

The third panel "ODE solver" allows to choose the integration method. Some methods
integrate with an adaptive, i.e., variable step; the output, however, can be obtained
at regularly spaced points by fixing the "Output Step" value: this is necessary in the
frequency analysis performed in the last panel.

The fourth panel "Revolution's number" allows to choose the number of revolutions in
the integration process and/or in the display: this last is useful in case of long
integration, when plotting the whole solution would generate an overloaded figure.

The fifth panel "Regularization method" is the core of the program. The button
"Integrate" performs the integration of the chosen Hamiltonian with the parameter
values fixed in the previous panels. Once the procedure is complete, several buttons
are enabled, allowing to display the dynamical evolution of many variables such as, for
example, the position and velocity vectors or the Kepler parameters. Moreover, the user
may write and display customized functions.

The sixth panel "Standard method" integrates directly the six Hamilton equations,
without regularization procedure. This is useful, in particular, when one must treat
unbounded cases.

Lastly, the seventh panel "Action--Angle variables and (Time--)Frequency analysis on
KAM tori" allows the analysis of how change the fundamental frequencies of a quasi-
integrable motion, detecting so the transition from order to chaos. The supplied
methods are the well known Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its local refinement, the
Frequency Modified Fourier Transform (FMFT); moreover, the Wavelet Transform (WT) allow
to study how changes the instantaneous frequency.

********* Action-Angle variables and Time-Frequency Analysis on KAM Tori ************
The panel "Action-Angle variables and Time-Frequency Analysis on KAM Tori"
allows to analyse how the fundamental frequencies of
a quasi-integrable motion change, detecting in this way the transition from
order to chaos. The two 3-dimensional Pauli vectors, defined in section
6.1.4 of the book, are the basic tool: they span two spheres and, once
fixed the energy value, they are in a 1-1 correspondence with elliptic
orbits, so that a stationary point for these two vectors (say, a relative
equilibrium point) locates a periodic elliptic orbit in the physical space.
Remark that a periodic orbit of the perturbed Kepler problem is in general a
slightly deformed ellipse; it is described by a periodic motion of the Pauli
vectors, covering a closed curve with the same frequency of the physical
motion. The "mean diameter" of the closed curve is in general very small and
gives an idea of how much the physical trajectory differs from an ellipses. We
will still call this small deformed curve "relative equilibrium point".
Five types of action--angle variables can be calculated and plotted.
1) The classical Delaunay variables are traditionally considered "the" action--angle
   variables of the Kepler problem. However, because of the complete total degeneration
   of the problem, in general they are not slightly deformed by a generic small
   perturbation but completely distorted, and the description by tori is lost.
2) The rotated Delaunay action-angle variables are defined as in the previous item, but
   after a rotation moving the relative equilibrium point to the north poles of
   the two spheres spanned by the Pauli vectors.
3) The Pauli action-angle variables are defined in subsection 6.1.4.
4) The rotated Pauli action-angle variables are defined as in the previous item, but
   after a rotation moving the relative equilibrium point to the north poles of
   the two spheres spanned by the Pauli vectors.
5) Action-angle variables defined by the user. Selecting one of the files in the folder
   "UserFunctions\UserActionAngle", the result is stored on memory and added to the
   further computations. To clear the memory, click on "Clear Append" in the third
   or fourth window. 
The Delaunay and Pauli action-angle variables are well suited for
perturbations with axial symmetry about the third axis, thus with the relative
equilibrium point placed at the two north poles. The rotated Delaunay and Pauli
action-angle variables instead are used for any perturbation, when the relative
equilibrium point is placed in generic position.
Let us examine how to use the seventh panel. When the integration is
completed, the buttons in the panel are enabled. By clicking on
"Pauli vectors", the dynamical evolution of these vectors is plotted and the
subpanel entitled "Normalized Pauli vectors of equilibrium
point" shows the mean value s1, s2, s3, d1, d2, d3 of the 3+3 components of the vectors,
along with the energy value: the idea is that the Pauli vectors rotate approximately
about their equilibrium point. If the "Enable Update button" is checked, by clicking on
"Pauli vectors" the values of s1, s2, s3, d1, d2, d3 are updated, then, clicking
on "Update initial conditions", the latter are synchronized with those
corresponding to the mean values of the Pauli vectors and to the energy just
now computed. Redoing the integration,
the Pauli vectors should now rotate closer to their equilibrium point so that,
by repeating the procedure three or four times, one should reach the very
neighborhood of a physical periodic orbit.

To check how close one is to the physical periodic orbit, inspect the plot of
space and momentum trajectories or, more effectively, look at the motion of
the "Rotated Pauli vectors". We recall that for periodic orbits the, practically
unattainable, optimum would be to get Pauli vectors describing two very small
closed curves. To this end, it is convenient to tune the initial
conditions - mainly eccentricity and inclination - quite delicately, 
then "Update Energy and Pauli vectors" and successively proceed to a new
integration. Note, however, that it is not mandatory to find exactly the
periodic orbit but, for what follows, only the two centers of the motion of
the Pauli vectors are relevant.

Once these two centers are found, it is convenient to freeze the values of the
Pauli vectors by unchecking the "Enable Update button'". Then, you may
explore the neighborhood of the physical periodic orbit by slightly changing
the initial conditions and integrating again. Clicking on "Rotated Pauli vectors",
the projections of the rotated Pauli vectors on the plane 1-2 will cover the
neighborhood of the origin, while the other blue buttons will show the evolution
of the Action-Angle variables. If the periodic orbit has been satisfactorily
determined, the related rotated-normalized variables will take on an approximately unitary value.

At this point, the user can analyze the spectrum of the three action variables
with three methods. The frequency of a circular unperturbed Keplerian orbit
with radius = 1 is taken as unity.
1) The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) gives an overall image of the whole
   spectrum but with the shortcoming that for a better resolution one should
   lengthen excessively the integration interval, calculating in this manner only
   an averaged frequency.
2) The Frequency Modified Fourier Transform (FMFT) allows a much more
   precise calculation of the frequencies in a narrow interval chosen by the
   user, which has at his disposal three methods of increasing precision: see at
   the end of subsection 5.3.2 of the book. The frequencies are ordered starting
   from the largest amplitude and are displayed in decreasing order. The user can
   also choose the number of frequencies to be displayed and their range: take
   into account that if one fixes a large number of frequencies and a narrow
   range, the time needed for the computation may grow excessively, which
   sometimes requires to kill the FMFT process directly from the operating system.
3) The Wavelet Transform (WT) allows to display the time evolution of the
   instantaneous frequency: see subsection 5.3.3. The user can choose
   the range of the frequency and the variance: it is advisable to take the value
   of the variance about 30 times that of the frequency.
If all the calculated frequencies turn out to be a linear combination with
integer coefficients of three fundamental frequencies, the spectrum is said to
be "regular" and the motion is "ordered", taking place on an invariant KAM torus.
Selecting the corresponding radiobutton, the FFT, FMFT or WT can be applied to
the four systems of action-angle variables of Delaunay and Pauli. Moreover,
the user may write and analyze custom functions.
*************************************************************************************

The other three windows are devoted to the study of the global properties of the whole
phase space. The second window contains the panel "Global analysis: Poincaré section"
for the problems with 2 degree of freedom. The third and fourth window contain the
panels "Global analysis: Rotated Delaunay" and "Global analysis: Rotated Pauli" to
study generic problems with Delaunay or Pauli action-angle variables, respectively. The
numerical tool is the Frequency Modulation Indicator (FMI). In order to obtain good
results, the computations invoked in the third and fourth window require very long
time, which can be shortened if the computer is a multicore model.

************************ Global analysis: Poincaré section ************************
The panel "Poincaré section and frequency map (plane system or with axial symmetry)"
is devoted to the study of the global structure of the whole
phase space, or of a portion of it, for systems with two degrees of freedom:
planar systems or with axial symmetry. In the latter case the third component
G3 of the angular momentum is a first integral, whose value is fixed by
the user. The offered tools are two.

1) The classical Poincaré map in the plane "angular momentun-argument of pericenter"
   with fixed energy chosen by the user, which can fix, moreover, the initial value of the
   argument of the pericenter, the min and max value of the angular
   momentum and the number of sections (= step number + 1). If the check box
   "Append" is selected, the sections under computation are kept in memory and
   automatically added to the subsequent outputs. The button "Clear" empties the memory.

2) The frequency analysis computed along a section G3 = constant with
   fixed energy. An output figure displays the values of the L-frequency and
   G-frequency as a function of G. The other output figure displays the ratio
   between the two frequencies: this is useful in detecting
   the resonances, which reveal themselves as plateaux in correspondence of
   rational values. The range of displayed values of the two frequencies can be choosen
   in the two subpanels "L--frequency" and
   "G-frequency". Choosing the null value for the step number, the max G
   field is disabled; checking "Frequency map (or single orbit)" and unchecking
   "Poincaré map", then clicking on "Calculate and plot" forces to jump
   to the first window (with initial values corresponding to the selected values
   of min G, G3, Total energy and argument of pericenter, while longitude of ascending
   node and true anomaly are null by default) and to compute the relative orbit.
   Afterwards one can perform the numerical frequency or wavelet analysis and compare
   it with the results of the Poincaré map.
   
************************* Global analysis: Rotated Delaunay **********************  
The panel "Frequency analysis and FMI for rotated and Normalized Delaunay variables"   
is devoted to the study of the global structure of the whole   
phase space, or of a portion of it, for generic systems with three degrees of   
freedom. The surface of constant total energy in the action space is   
parametrized by G and G3 and covered with a rectangular grid. The   
button "Calculate . . ." performs the numerical analysis of the frequencies on   
the points of the grid, then the result is displayed clicking on the three   
buttons in the subpanel ". . . and plot". In particular, for the button   
"FMI" (the meaning of the other two is evident) we recall the   
definition: once computed an orbit, perform several numerical frequency   
analysis, say N, shifting each time the window of some Delta, and   
take the largest (= max) and smallest (= min) of the N output values. For a suitable Delta   
(but the choice is not very critical) and N large enough, the   
difference between the two values will result proportional to the amplitude   
of the frequency modulation, which in turn is a spy of the presence of a resonance.   
N may be chosen in "Step number for FMI". Let us define the Frequency   
Modulation Indicator (FMI) as   
                 sigma = log((max - min)/(max + min))   
Clearly, sigma = - infinity for orbits of KAM type starting   
sufficiently far away from a resonance of low order, while the high order   
resonances are practically not detectable in numerical investigations. In the   
graphical representation one usually chooses a cut-off, i.e., raises all the   
lower values to, for example, sigma = - 12. Instead, inside a   
resonance or in its very neighbourhood, sigma will be in   
general larger, growing with the amplitude of the frequency modulation.   
Notice, however, that the FMI is very effective in showing where the   
resonances are, but requires long integration times to give   
reliable information of what happens inside them; to this end, it is more   
advantageous to compute the frequency values along suited sections: see below.   
   
The frequencies are progressively numbered as 1,2,3. If the 3x3 matrix   
on the subpanel "Unimodular transformation" is the identity, they coincide   
with the L-frequency, G-frequency and G3-frequency respectively. But the   
action-angle variables are defined up to a unimodular transformation,   
represented by a matrix with integer entries and unit determinant: inside a   
resonance one can thus define three new angles such that one of them coincides   
with the resonant angle. We recall that a resonant angle performs librations,   
i.e., oscillations, instead of rotations. The dynamical evolution of the three   
new action-angle variables can be viewed clicking on "User function" of the   
panel "Regularization Method" of the first window, then selecting a file of the   
type AADelaunayprime_x.m or AAPauliprime_x.m in the UserActionAngle directory.   
Notice that in the thin stochastic layer surrounding the separatrices between   
libration and circulation, the point "hesitates", choosing randomly between   
the two behaviours: this is the source of the chaos.   
   
For a more precise local analysis, the user can compute the frequencies along   
a section G = constant or G3 = constant: to this end, select the null   
value for the total step number of G or G3, respectively, then click on   
"Compute . . .". The final output can be viewed with the buttons of the   
subpanel ". . . and plot". Selecting, instead, the null value for the total   
step number of G and G3, one jumps to the first window, where   
the computation of the relative orbit starts.   
   
In order to obtain good results, the computations invoked in the third and   
fourth window require very long times, which can be shortened if the computer   
is a multicore machine. Indeed, KEPLER is able to parallelize the computations   
in the following way. If you possess an n-core machine, in an empty folder   
"Kepler" create a subfolder "Master" and n-1 subfolders   
"Slave1", "Slave2", . . . , then copy the whole program KEPLER   
identically in every folder. Start MATLAB then KEPLER from the "Master"   
folder, set the parameters and click on "File/Save setting now". WITHOUT   
CLOSING, start a new instance of MATLAB, then KEPLER from a folder   
"SlaveX": you will notice that all the buttons of the computations are   
disabled while the new button "Start Slave" appears. Click on this button   
and KEPLER will wait for the start of the master. Redo for every slave, lastly   
go back to the master and click on "Calculate . . .". The whole work will be   
automatically shared among the n cores. The final result is displayed by the master.   

************************* Global analysis: Rotated Pauli **********************
The window "Frequency map for Rotated and Normalized Pauli variables" is devoted
to the study of the global structure of the whole phase space, or of a portion of it,
for generic systems with three degrees of freedom but with the actions S3 and D3 replacing
G and G3; the conjugate angles are calculated in subsection 6.1.4 of the book.
The instructions for use are like those in the third window.
