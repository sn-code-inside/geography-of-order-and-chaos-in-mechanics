The LAPLACE program computes numerically the dynamics of a generic solar system, with a central massive star and
at most 10 planets. The computing kernel can be chosen between HNBODY and MERCURY6.
LAPLACE is organized in one window with four panels and some menus.

************************** First Panel: Initial Conditions ******************************************************

By default, mass values and initial conditions are adjusted on our solar system, with 8 planets plus Pluto and one
asteroid, but the user can choose other values and even eliminate some planets, leaving blank the relative mass
field. The units of measure are: the AU (radius of the Earth orbit), the year = 365.25 days, and the Sun's mass.
All angles are expressed in degrees, with 1 deg = pi/180 rad.

*************************** Second Panel: Integration ************************************************************

Clicking on <Integrate> starts the numerical integration. With HNBODY the user
can choose among three different methods: symplectic (default and recommended), Bulirsch--Stoer, and Runge--Kutta.
The first method has a fixed integration step, chosen by the user along with the output step. The latter two
instead have an adaptive step, which automatically ensures a relative accuracy = 10^{-12}, while the output step
is still fixed and chosen by the user. The symplectic method is based on the algorithm of Wisdom-Holman, named
Mixed Variable Symplectic (MVS), which alternates the advance due to the pure Keplerian dynamics with that due to
the sole perturbation. MERCURY6 uses a different algorithm and can therefore serve as a useful comparison. It
provides four methods: symplectic, Radau (i.e., Runge-K-Kutta implicit), Bulirsch--Stoer, and Hybrid (able to deal
with close encounters between planets). 

The integration step must be chosen taking into account the planets involved in the calculation. As a guide, we
choose 0.01 if the terrestrial planets are present and 0.1--0.4 if only jovians are. When choosing a long Output
Step, bear in mind that this shortens the duration of the integration time.

Checking the box <Relativistic correction>, affects consequently the
computation of the motion of the pericenter longitude.

******************** Third Panel: Plot, Frequency Analysis, and Lyapunov} ****************************************

When the numerical integration process is completed, various fields of the panel are enabled. In the two pop-up
menus on the left the user can choose the parameters to plot and the relative planet. If the box 
<User function> is checked, the user will be prompted to choose a personal script. Some files are
provided as an example: AA_two_planets.m (see also below) and Xxx_Orbit.m to plot the 3D-orbit of the planets.
Until the button <Clear append> is enabled, the results of subsequent computations are kept in memory
and automatically added to the new graphical output.

Clicking on <Plot> the chosen parameter of the relative planet is displayed.

Clicking on <Check resonances> a new window appears. The button
<Plot> --- whose icon shows two tuning forks --- displays the evolution of the
angle that could be in resonance. This angle is the linear combination of those selected in the second column and
relating to the planets in the third column, with integer coefficients in the first column: if the angle librates,
we are in the resonance, otherwise it evolves monotonically.

Clicking on <Lyapunov time> a second orbit is computed, called
<shadow orbit>. All parameters remain unchanged except for the semi-major axis
of the planet selected above, which is increased by 15 cm. Then the <true> and
the <shadow orbit> are compared and six figures are displayed, giving you an
idea of how quickly the two orbits move away from each other.

The first figure shows the Lyapunov time. If the motion is chaotic, the distance between the two orbits
will grow exponentially and the Lyapunov time will reach a finite
value, otherwise it will tend to infinity. The critical choice is deciding how long the integration
process should last.

The second figure gives the physical distance in AU, while the third gives the difference between the two
mean longitudes in degrees. The last figures shows the differences between the three action-type variables. As can
be seen, the distance between the two orbits is due almost exclusively to the increase in the mean anomaly,
which means that the orbits of the planets remain practically unchanged but are covered with different speeds.

<Start demodulation> computes how the fundamental frequencies of the orbit
change in the time and gives an idea of how regular it is.

The right side of the panel is devoted to the frequency analysis of the same planet displayed in the second
pop-up menu on the left, and it is very similar to the corresponding part in the first window of the KEPLER
program. The three output frequencies are relative to: semimajor axis-mean longitude, eccentricity-longitude
of perihelion and inclination-longitude of ascending node.

 *********************** Fourth Panel: Frequency Modulation Indicator ********************************************

When N planets are present, the action space is 3N-dimensional so that one must pick out a 2-dimensional
section plane. The FMI will be computed taking all the actions fixed, with the exception of those spanning the
grid on the section plane. The four pop-up menus of the panel allow one to choose the two planets and the
corresponding two actions with their range, while all the other actions will keep the constant value displayed in
the first panel <Initial conditions>. The two planets can be the same;
consequently the two actions must be different. The <step number> fields fix
the dimension of the rectangular grid on which the FMI is computed. The right side of the panel is equal to the
corresponding part in the third/fourth window of the KEPLER program.

************************************* Menu ***********************************************************************

The menu of LAPLACE is very similar to that of KEPLER except for the <Normal form>, which displays two windows.

In <Global planar secular 3-body> the user may perform the computations
described in the homonymous section. To start using the program,
choose the masses of the two planets, their semimajor axes and their eccentricities. This choice automatically
determines the value of G_tot which cannot be modified directly but only via these parameters. Moving
the slider in the panel <Unperturbed orbits> it is possible to
cover the entire range of admitted values, leaving the G_tot value blocked and modifying the
eccentricity values accordingly. This makes it possible to verify if the orbits of the two planets never get too
close, as this violates the assumptions of the calculation. For safety, make sure that the analytical and
numerical calculation results of the Action--Angles are in good agreement.

<Lagrange--Laplace theory> performs the computations of the Lagrange--Laplace linear theory and displays
the result. Clicking on <Compute> enable all the
buttons, moreover two files reporting the eigenfrequencies of the eight planets appears in the Editor. Since the
secular motion of the planets is calculated exponentiating these eigenfrequencies --- which are known exactly ---
the use of <Fast Fourier Transform> and <FMFT> constitute a test to evaluate the accuracy of the two procedures.
<Compute and plot eigenfrequencies> shows how the secular frequencies of the planets vary when the
semimajor axis of one of them covers a predetermined interval.
